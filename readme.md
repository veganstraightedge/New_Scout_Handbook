# A New Scout Handbook
Not at all related to the "official" Cub, Boy or Girl Scouts. Merely inspired by my childhood experience in the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts. A wilderness and urban survival manual for kids and adults alike without the hangups of the Cub/Boy/Girl Scouts.

## Ideals
* **Decentralization**

  No over arching organization needs to exist. A network is more resilient than a hierarchy.

* **No Gods**

  Belief in a deity doesn't affect one's ability to start a fire or build a shelter.

* **No Masters**

  No leaders. No ranks. Peer to peer learning and experience.

* **No Country**

  No flags. No pledges. No allegiance to nations or states. State lines do not matter.

* **Gender Neutrality**

  Boys and girls and everywhere in between.

* **No Military Subtext**

  No salutes. No uniforms. This is not the training program for the armed forces.
